# Projects

Hello . There are projects for front end developers in this repository !


The basis of these projects is the knowledge of JavaScript (vanilla) and CSS.
Pay attention to addresses, CDNs, and SRCs when implementing projects.
This repository will be updated over time


If you see a bug in a project, I will be happy to tell me (humans make mistakes!) and if you have an interesting feature.
Your life without bugs !
